(ns kotoba.compiler.kotoba-reader
  "A small, purpose-built reader for the admission-gated `.kotoba` grammar
  (lists, vectors, maps, sets, keywords, symbols, integers, strings, and
  `#?(...)` reader-conditionals), used ONLY on the `:cljs` (nbb) side.

  This exists because `kotoba.compiler.frontend`'s reference reader is
  `clojure.tools.reader`, a JVM-only library. Its nominal ClojureScript
  sibling (`cljs.tools.reader`, same Maven artifact) turned out to depend on
  several `cljs.core` internals (`cljs.core.ExceptionInfo` instance checks,
  `IPrintWithWriter`/`pr-writer` protocol dispatch, and a `:require-macros`
  cross-namespace macro) that nbb's SCI-based interpreter does not resolve --
  confirmed by spiking it directly (three distinct unresolved-symbol classes
  in as many fixes, not one isolated gap). Rather than keep chasing an
  open-ended compatibility surface against a general-purpose reader never
  designed for SCI, this reader covers exactly the grammar
  `kotoba.compiler.frontend/analyze` actually accepts (see its
  `forbidden-heads`/`reserved-function-names` and the total absence of `#{`
  or `#?` in every checked-in `examples/*.kotoba` fixture) plus `#?()`
  reader-conditionals and `#{}` sets for read-time parity with the JVM path
  (frontend still requests `:read-cond :allow` and a set literal must at
  least PARSE the same on both runtimes, even though `validate-expr` rejects
  a set value identically on both afterward).

  Integer literals are parsed as JS `bigint` (not `js/Number`), so a literal
  at the true i64 boundary (e.g. -9223372036854775808) round-trips exactly
  instead of losing precision the moment it's read -- required for
  `kotoba.compiler.ir`'s compile-time oracle (constant-folds a pure `main`
  by literally *executing* it) to match the JVM path's `Long` wraparound
  arithmetic bit-for-bit, not just within the JS safe-integer range."
